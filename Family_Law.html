<h4>What We Do</h4>
</p>
<p>
We handle all manner of family law issues, but many of our clients come in to ask for assistance regarding:
</p>
<p>
    Custody and visitation — Our attorneys have handled every type of child custody case, including cases involving complex issues such as moving out of state and grandparents’ visitation rights. You don’t have to be getting a divorce to need a custody and visitation agreement; we help all parents and relatives who are looking out for the well-being of their family members.
</p>
<p>    Child support — Similar to child custody, you do not have to be going through a divorce to need legal counsel about a child support agreement. While there is no such thing as a final agreement when it comes to child custody, visitation or support, it is important to secure a fair and favorable child support agreement early on in the process. Modifications are possible down the road, but these are not always easy to secure so it is important to garner a productive outcome early in the process.
</p>
<p>    Modifications — While some family law decisions are permanently binding, other orders and judgments can be modified if circumstances substantially change. We help clients with post-judgment modifications for alimony, custody and visitation, and child support payments.
</p>
<p>    Prenuptial agreements — In addition to helping people dissolve marriages, we also assist people who are getting married and wish to protect their assets. We can help you draft a prenuptial agreement, as well as review a prenup prepared by your future spouse’s lawyer. When negotiating a prenuptial agreement, it is important to have your own attorney to represent your best interests.
</p>
<p>    Adoptions — The family structure has changed over the years, and we assist families that wish to adopt children in Massachusetts as well as out-of-state adoptions. We also help clients adopt their stepchildren or grandchildren. We can handle all aspects of stepparent adoptions and grandparent adoptions so that your loving family is also a legal family.
</p>
<p>    Establishing paternity — Schneiders & Schneiders works with mothers and fathers to establish paternity and rights to custody and visitation. We are advocates for fathers’ rights and mothers’ rights, and we work to make sure that both parents are involved in their child’s life. We can help you prove paternity in order to visit your child or to get child support.
</p>
<p>    Restraining orders and domestic violence issues — People who suffer from abuse at home have a remedy under Massachusetts law: the 209A restraining order. This law covers all “family and household members”: people who are married, living together, related by blood or marriage, or have a child together. We can help you file an application for a restraining order and represent you in all court appearances. This temporary order will force your abuser to leave your home, stay away from you and your children, and have no contact with you until the next hearing.

If you and your family need assistance with a complex family law issue, contact Schneiders & Schneiders today to arrange a free consultation.
