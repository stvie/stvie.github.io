<h4>
What You Can Expect As A Client
</h4>

<p>
When you need legal representation, you should be able to expect the best from your attorney without having to worry about going bankrupt in the process. No matter what your legal issues or problems may be, our firm believes there are some things you cannot and should not have to do without. We ensure that our clients receive the utmost from our firm, including:
</p>
<p>
    Outstanding personal attention — Our clients never have to worry about who is truly handling their case, or wonder who to call or question what is really happening in their case. We do not insulate ourselves from clients by making them fight through small armies of support staff just to speak with us. We make ourselves available to speak with you when questions or concerns arise.
</p>
<p>
    Honest and open communication — Being upfront with our clients is the foundation of our relationship with the people we represent. This begins by setting realistic expectations that accurately reflect the strengths and weaknesses of your situation.
</p>
<p>
    Clear explanations and information regarding: the law; your legal options; and what to expect at each stage of the process. Lastly, whether the news is good or bad, or the decisions large or small — we keep you informed and fully involved.
</p>
<p>
    Lawyers who see the big picture — What we may lack in terms of staff numbers, we make up for in the depth of our experience and legal knowledge. We are determined to see the bigger picture, recognize the uniqueness of every client’s situation and achieve the right solutions for each person.
</p>

<h4>
Your Interests Matter
</h4>

<p>
We aim to be a strongly client-centered law firm, and part of that approach is offering the best services possible to our clients. One of the ways we do that is by offering free initial consultations to all prospective clients so they can get a case evaluation, a flavor for our way of doing business and a firm understanding of the road ahead.
</p>
<p>
We also offer appointments in the evening and on the weekends and make ourselves available to clients at our office locations in Boston and Canton, as well as offering at-home and hospital appointments. Credit cards are accepted for all of our legal services, though personal injury clients can rest assured that we receive no fee unless we successfully obtain a verdict or settlement on your behalf.
